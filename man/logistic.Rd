\usage{
logistic(
  dataset,
  rvar,
  evar,
  lev = "",
  int = "",
  wts = "None",
  check = "",
  form,
  ci_type,
  data_filter = "",
  envir = parent.frame()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Dataset}

\item{rvar}{The response variable in the model}

\item{evar}{Explanatory variables in the model}

\item{lev}{The level in the response variable defined as _success_}

\item{int}{Interaction term to include in the model}

\item{wts}{Weights to use in estimation}

\item{check}{Use "standardize" to see standardized coefficient estimates. Use "stepwise-backward" (or "stepwise-forward", or "stepwise-both") to apply step-wise selection of variables in estimation. Add "robust" for robust estimation of standard errors (HC1)}

\item{form}{Optional formula to use instead of rvar, evar, and int}

\item{ci_type}{To use the profile-likelihood (rather than Wald) for confidence intervals use "profile". For datasets with more than 5,000 rows the Wald method will be used, unless "profile" is explicitly set}

\item{data_filter}{Expression entered in, e.g., Data > View to filter the dataset in Radiant. The expression should be a string (e.g., "price > 10000")}

\item{envir}{Environment to extract data from}
}
